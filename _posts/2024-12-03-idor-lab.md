I love [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security){:target="blank"}, the labs have been a great resource to learn and practice my web hacking skills. Here is a quick write-up on solving this [Access Control lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-insecure-direct-object-references){:target="blank"}, we are looking specifically at an [IDOR vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor){:target="blank"}. Here is the info we are given:

>This lab stores user chat logs directly on the server's file system, and retrieves them using static URLs.
Solve the lab by finding the password for the user carlos, and logging into their account.

Yikes! 

After looking around the site, we find the live chat page and start chatting.

With our message sent, we click `View transcript`, we go to our intercepting proxy and look at the request that was sent to download the transcript.
```
GET /download-transcript/5.txt HTTP/2
```

Cool, let's send that to Repeater and try changing the `5` to a `1` and resending the request. Perfect! We found the transcript where `carlos` sent his credentials to the agent.

We login as carlos to solve the lab.
