As someone that grew up always looking for the easy way out of everything, these books changed my life and outlook on the importance of getting shit done:


1. **Can’t Hurt Me** *(David Goggins)*
2. **Steve Jobs** *(Walter Isaacson)*
3. **Relentless** *(Eddie Hearn)*
4. **Never Finished** *(David Goggins)*
5. **Elon Musk** *(Walter Isaacson)*

If you’re feeling stuck in life, I recommend all of them. Good luck, have fun!
