As someone that grew up always looking for the easy way out of everything, these books changed my life and outlook on the importance of getting shit done:

```
Can’t Hurt Me (David Goggins)
Steve Jobs (Walter Isaacson)
Relentless (Eddie Hearn)
Never Finished (David Goggins)
Elon Musk (Walter Isaacson)
```
If you’re feeling stuck in life, I recommend all of them. Good luck, have fun!
